Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

Examples: 
[2,3,4] , the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.

class MedianFinder {
public:
    /** initialize your data structure here. */
    priority_queue<int> small, large; // by default it is the max queue and it will have the max element in the front,i.e., pop will pop the smallest element in the list which is in the back of the list. Example: (6,5,4,3,2,1) and pop will remove 1
    
    void addNum(int num) {
        small.push(num);
        large.push(-small.top());
        small.pop();
        if(small.size() < large.size()){
            small.push(-large.top());
            large.pop();
        }
    }
    
    double findMedian() {
        return (small.size() > large.size()) ? small.top() :  (small.top() - large.top())/2.0;
    }
};

/**
 * Your MedianFinder object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * MedianFinder obj = new MedianFinder();
 * obj.addNum(num);
 * double param_2 = obj.findMedian();
 */
