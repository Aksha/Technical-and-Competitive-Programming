#Find the maximum successive sum in an array

Solution:
The idea is simple. Keep checking if the current element is bigger or the existing sum + the current element is bigger. 
Get the max of that and check it against the maximum sum found so far. Once you are done iterating through the all the 
input elements return the maximum sum found so far.  Time complexity is O(n). 

int maxSubArray(int a[]){
  int answer = 0;
  int sum = 0;
  for(int i = 0; i < a.size(); i++) {
    sum = max(sum+a[i], a[i]);
    answer = max(sum, answer);
  }
  return answer;
}
