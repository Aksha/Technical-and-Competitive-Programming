Given a set of strings, find the longest common prefix.

Input  : {“geeksforgeeks”, “geeks”, “geek”, “geezer”}
Output : "gee"

Input  : {"apple", "ape", "april"}
Output : "ap"

Solution: 

There are several different solutions to this problem with different time and space complexity. I will discuss 
all the approaches one by one here.

First Approach: Associative property.

We start with an example. Suppose there are two strings- “geeksforgeeks” and “geeks”. What is the longest common prefix in both of them? It is “geeks”.

Now let us introduce another word “geek”. So now what is the longest common prefix in these three words ? It is “geek”

We can see that the longest common prefix holds the associative property, i.e-

LCP(string1, string2, string3) 
         = LCP (LCP (string1, string2), string3)

Like here

LCP (“geeksforgeeks”, “geeks”, “geek”)
     =  LCP (LCP (“geeksforgeeks”, “geeks”), “geek”)
     =  LCP (“geeks”, “geek”) = “geek”
