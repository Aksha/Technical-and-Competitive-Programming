Given a diagonal acylic graph, find the longest path from the source to all possible nodes in the graph.

Solution:

The input is a struct Node that has the following entries, A source node, A destination and the distance between the two.

Struct NodeBunch{
  char source;
  char destination;
  int distance;
  NodeBunch(char s, char d, int dist){
    source = s;
    destination = d;
    distance = dist;
  }
};

vector<char, int> longestpath (vector <NodeBunch> input){

}
