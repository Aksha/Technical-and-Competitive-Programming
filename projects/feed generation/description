There are three files used in this python script for generating Syte_Retired_Feed.xml (retailers.csv, brands.csv, test1)
a. retailers.csv is generated from the retailer service. It has two columns(one for retailer ID and the other for retailer name).
b. brands.csv is generated from the brand service. It has two columns(one for brand ID and the other for brand name).
c. test1 is generated by running the following query against any prod machine: mongo prod-mongodbcatalog-master.shopstyleops.com/catalog -u username -p password --eval 'db.products.find({ "$and": [ {"s":"Retired"}, {"ct": {"$ne": "Beauty"} }, {"ct": {"$ne": "Men"} }, {"$or": [ {"ct":"Dresses"}, {"ct":"Athletic"}, {"ct":"Shorts"}, {"ct":"Sneakers"}, {"ct":"Tops"}, {"ct":"Hats"}, {"ct":"Jeans"}, {"ct":"Sweaters"}, {"ct":"Boots"}, {"ct":"Jackets"}, {"ct":"Pumps"}, {"ct":"Sandals"}, {"ct":"Handbags"}, {"ct":"Bags"}, {"ct":"Skirts"}, {"ct":"Pants"} ] } ] }, {"p.iu":1, "n":1, "d": 1, "ct":1, "rc": 1, "bid": 1, "rid": 1, "rn":1, "co":1, "ps": 1}).sort({"lm":-1}).limit(10000000)' . It has information like the id, image_link, title, description, category tags, retailer_categories.
