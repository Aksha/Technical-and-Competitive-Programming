# Find minimum distance between two words (order preserved) in a big string. 
For e.g 1. "hello how are you" - distance between "hello" and "you" is 3. 
e.g 2. "hello how are hello you" - distance is 1 
e.g 3. "you are hello" - distance is -1. Order of "hello" and "you" should be preserved. 
e.g 4. "hello how are hello" - distance is -1 since "you" didnt occur even once.

My solution - might be naive  O(n)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) whenever you encounter a space in the sentence of string data type, make it a word and push it into a vector or a hashmap std::map 
as a key with its value as count (keep incrementing count everytime you insert a word in the map/vector and set it as its key)
2) Lookup the words to find in the hashmap and note down its value.
3) Find out the absolute difference between the two and return it.
