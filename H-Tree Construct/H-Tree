An H-tree is a geometric shape that consists of a repeating pattern resembles the letter “H”.

It can be constructed by starting with a line segment of arbitrary length, drawing two segments of
the same length at right angles to the first through its endpoints, and continuing in the same vein, 
reducing (dividing) the length of the line segments drawn at each stage by √2.

there are some examples of H-trees at different levels of depth in this folder for your reference.
Write a function drawHTree that constructs an H-tree, given its center (x and y coordinates), a starting length, 
and depth. Assume that the starting line is parallel to the X-axis.

Use the function drawLine provided to implement your algorithm. In a production code, a drawLine function 
would render a real line between two points. However, this is not a real production environment, so to make
things easier, implement drawLine such that it simply prints its arguments (the print format is left to your discretion).

Analyze the time and space complexity of your algorithm. In your analysis, assume that drawLine's time and
space complexities are constant, i.e. O(1).


1. given = start length and depth.
2. A method drawLine whose time and space complexity is constant and it renders a real line between two points.
2. find = all the points of the H's formed at every depth
3. technique, recursively call the same method with different depths as inputs


Solution:
vector<vector<point>> drawLine(point center, double length, int depth){
  
  vector<vector<point>> result;
  drawHTree(point.x,point.y,length,depth,result);
  return result;
}

void drawHTree(int x, int y, double length, int depth, vector<vector<int>>& result){
  if(depth == 0)
    break;
  
  double x0 = x - length/2;
  double y0 = y - length/2;
  double x1 = x + length /2;
  double y1 = y + length/2;
  
  temp.push_back(drawLine(x0,y0,x0,y1));//let's assume that drawLine returns the arguments of this line.
  temp.push_back(drawLine(x1,y1,x1,y0));
  temp.push_back(drawLine(x0,y,x1,y));
  result.push_back(temp);
  temp.erase();
  
  newLength = length/sqrt(2);
  
  //topleft
  drawHTree(x0,y0,newLength,depth-1);
  //topright
  drawHTree(x0,y1,newLength,depth-1);
  //bottomleft
  drawHTree(x1,y0,newLength,depth-1);
  //bottomright
  drawHTree(x1,y1,newLength,depth-1);
}

Time complexity: 4^depth.
Space: Space Complexity: recursive calls add overhead since we store them in the execution stack.
The space occupied in the stack will be then O(D), in the worst case scenario. The stack space occupied 
will be no more than O(D) at any given point since a sibling drawHTree will not be called before the current 
one being executed returns (i.e. finishes its execution).
