/*
Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].
                    ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes","practice", "perfect"] word1="makes" word2="perfect"
Given word1 = “coding”, word2 = “practice”, return 3. 
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "coding", return 1.

Note:
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.

Hash Map ->String, integer
both the words in different map 
word1Index=-1,
word2Index=-1,
absDifference=always compare.
