# Technical-and-competitive-programming

I practise problem solving  using data structures, algorithms because I enjoy writing code and sharing my knowledge. I invest a lot more time in trying to come up with an optimized approach rather than being complacent with a brute force solution which in turn helps flex my mental muscles and improve critical thinking. Hope you find some of the solutions posted in this repository useful
