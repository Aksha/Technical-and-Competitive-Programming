# Technical-and-competitive-programming

I practise problem solving everyday using data structures, algorithms because I enjoy writing code and sharing my knowledge in competitive programming. I invest a lot more time in trying to come up with an optimized approach rather than being complacent with a brute force solution which in turn helps flex my mental muscles and improve critical thinking. Hope you find the solution to these problems useful.
