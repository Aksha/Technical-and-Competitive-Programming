Given two sorted arrays arr1 and arr2 of passport numbers, implement a function findDuplicates that returns an array 
of all passport numbers that are both in arr1 and arr2. Note that the output array should be sorted in an ascending order.

Let N and M be the lengths of arr1 and arr2, respectively. Solve for two cases and analyze the time & space 
complexities of your solutions: M ≈ N - the array lengths are approximately the same M ≫ N - arr2 is much bigger than arr1.

Example:

input:  arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], arr2 = [3, 6, 7, 8, 20]

output: [3, 6, 7] # since only these three values are both in arr1 and arr2
Constraints:

[time limit] 5000ms

[input] array.integer arr1

1 ≤ arr1.length ≤ 100
[input] array.integer arr2

1 ≤ arr2.length ≤ 100
[output] array.integer

Solution for each case:
case 1 when M ~ N

vector<int> findDuplicates(vector <int> arr1, vector <int> arr2){
  int n = arr1.size();
  int m = arr2.size();
  int i , j = 0;
  while(i < arr1.size() && j < arr2.size()){
    if(arr1[i] == arr2[j]){
      result.push_back(arr1[i]);
      i++;
      j++;
    }
    else if(arr1[i] > arr2[j]){
      j++;
    }
    else 
      i++;
  }
  if(result.size() == 0)
    return -1;
  return result;
}

This solution has linear time complexity with O(n) is n is larger and O(m) if m is larger.

Case 2: if M > N = the time complexity is O(nlogm) in this case and space compledxity will be O(n) worst case.

vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int> &arr1, vector<int> &arr2) {
  // your code goes here
  int n = arr1.size();
  int m = arr2.size();
  int start = 0;
  int end = m-1;
  vector<int> result;
  for(int i = 0; i < arr1.size(); i++){
    while(start < end){
      int mid = start + (end-start)/2;
      if(arr1[i] == arr2[mid]){
        result.push_back(arr1[i]);
      }
      else if(arr1[i] > arr2[mid])
        start = mid+1;
      else 
        end = mid-1;
    }
    start = 0;
    end = m-1;
  }
  return result;
}
// 3, 6, 7

int main() {
  vector <int> arr1 = {1,2,3,5,6,7};
  vector <int> arr2 = {3,6,7,8,20};
  vector <int> result = findDuplicates(arr1,arr2);
  for(int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++)
    cout << result[i];
  return 0;
}
