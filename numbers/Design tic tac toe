In a tic tac toe, a player wins when the player has an entire column or an entire row or a diagonal or anti diagonal. Let us
suppose there are two players playing the game with a board that has rows x columns.

Class TicTacToe {
  vector <int> rows;
  vector <int> columns;
  int diagonals = 0;
  int anti-diagonals = 0;
  
  TicTacToe(int n){
    rows = rows.resize(n);
    columns = columns.resize(n);
  }
  
  int move (int row, int col, int player){
        int toAdd = (player == 1) ? 1: -1;
        
        rows[row] += toAdd;
        columns[col] += toAdd;
        if(row == col){
          diagonal += toAdd;
        }
        if(row == (n -1)-col){
          anti-diagonal += toADD
        }  
        int size = rows.size();
        if(abs(rows[row]) == size || abs(cols[column]) == size || abs(diagonal) == size || abs(anti-diagonal) == size))
          return player;
        return 0;
   }
};
