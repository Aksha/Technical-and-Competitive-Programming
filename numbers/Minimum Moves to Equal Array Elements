Given a non-empty integer array of size n, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing n - 1 elements by 1.

Example:

Input:
[1,2,3]

Output:
3

Explanation:
Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):

[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]

[6,3,5,6,8] => 13 steps later => [16,16,16,16,16] or [3,3,3,3,3] because Adding 1 to n - 1 elements is the same as subtracting 1 from one element, w.r.t goal of making the elements in the array equal.
So, best way to do this is make all the elements in the array equal to the min element.
sum(array) - n * minimum

class Solution {
   int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int minimum = nums[0];
        for (int n : nums) minimum = std::min(min, n);
        int res = 0;
        for (int n : nums) res += n - minimum;
        return res;
    }
}
