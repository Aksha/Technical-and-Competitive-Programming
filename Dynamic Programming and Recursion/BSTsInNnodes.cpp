	Any BST with n nodes can be divided in 3 parts, 
	1) root.
	2) left sub-BST. 
	3) right sub-BST.
	
	There will be always one root hence structure of BST will only depend on the left sub-BST and 
	the right sub-BST. 

	We have 1 root fixed hence we have n - 1 nodes in left sub-BST + right sub-BST.
	So that is,
	n - 1 = nodes in left sub-BST + nodes in right sub-BST. 
	To get all the possibilities we can fix nodes in left sub-BST and get nodes in right sub-BST!
	So from the above formula,

	nodes in left sub-BST -> nodes in right sub-BST
	
	0 -> n - 1
	1 -> n - 2
	2 -> n - 3
	...
	n - 3 -> 2 
	n - 2 -> 1
	n - 1 -> 0

	Now suppose we take one fixed possibility 2 (nodes in left sub-BST) -> n - 3 
	(nodes in right sub-BST), then if we can get total number of BSTs possible with 2 nodes 
	(let's say it is x) and total number of BSTs possible with n - 3 nodes (let's say it is y), 
	then we can get the total number of BSTs possible with n nodes for the current possibility 
	(WHEN IN LEFT SUB-BST WE HAVE 2 NODES AND IN RIGHT SUB-BST WE HAVE n - 3 NODES) by x * y. Now 
	question is why x * y? For BST with n nodes we will fix one root, on the left subBST we fix 1 
	tree out of x possible BSTs, then to create BST with n nodes, we can use any of the y possible
	BSTs on the right sub-BST. So for one fixed sub-BST on left side we have generated y BSTs with
	n nodes. Now doing this for all x sub-BSTs possible on left side, total number of generated 
	BSTs = y + y + ... y (total x times) and that is x * y. (This will be difficult to understand 
	unless you try some examples yourself.)

	Now as we have done for 2 -> n - 3, we can try all possibilities and get the final answer 
	denoting total number of BSTS possible with n nodes!

	Let's take a small example n = 3 and see how every possible BST is covered in one of the 
	parition.
	All possible BSTs with 3 nodes are,
	1) root, root->left, root->left->left
	2) root, root->left, root->left->right
	3) root, root->right, root->right->right
	4) root, root->right, root->right->left
	5) root, root->left, root->right

	Now if we try:
	0 -> 2
	1 -> 1
	2 -> 0

	then we can divide the above 5 possibilities as:
	0 -> 2 : 	3) root, root->right, root->right->right
				4) root, root->right, root->right->left
	1 -> 1 : 	5) root, root->left, root->right
	2 -> 0 : 	1) root, root->left, root->left->left
				2) root, root->left, root->left->right
